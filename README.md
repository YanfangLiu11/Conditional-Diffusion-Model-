# Conditional-Diffusion-Model-
This repository presents a training-free conditional diffusion model for learning unknown stochastic differential equations.

## Overview
This project aims to address key challenges in computational efficiency and accuracy for modeling SDEs by using a score-based generative model to approximate the stochastic flow map of unknown stochastic equations.

## Examples
The examples are as follows:
1. 1D Ornstein-Uhlenbeck(OU) process
2. Geometric Brownian Motion
3. SDE with exponential diffusion
4. SDE with trigonometric drift and diffusion
5. Double Well Potential
6. Noises with Exponential Distribution
7. Noises with Lognormal Distribution
8. 2D Ornstein-Uhlenbeck(OU) process
9. 5D Ornstein-Uhlenbeck(OU) process
